# From-300MB-to-8MB-Practical-Transformer-Compression-for-Deployment
This article provides a comprehensive guide to compressing Transformer models from 300MB to 8MB through quantization, distillation, and ONNX optimization, complete with code examples and performance benchmarks.
Here’s a concise English summary of the key techniques for Transformer model compression (300MB → 8MB) using Quantization, Distillation, and ONNX Optimization:
Transformer Model Compression: From 300MB to 8MB

Core Techniques:

    1、Knowledge Distillation

        Train a compact Student model (e.g., 4-layer TinyBERT) by mimicking outputs and intermediate features of a large Teacher (e.g., BERT-base).

        Code: Loss combines KL divergence (soft labels) and MSE (hidden states).

        Result: 300MB → 50MB, <2% accuracy drop.

    2、Quantization

        Dynamic Quantization: Convert weights to INT8 (PyTorch quantize_dynamic), no data needed.

        Static Quantization: Calibrate activations with representative data for higher speedup.

        QAT (Quant-Aware Training): Simulate quantization during training for minimal accuracy loss.

        Result: 50MB → 12.5MB (INT8), 2-3x faster inference.

    3、ONNX Conversion & Optimization

        Export to ONNX with dynamic axes for flexible deployment.

        Optimize via operator fusion and INT8 quantization (ONNX Runtime).

        Deploy on edge devices (Android NNAPI, TensorRT) with 4x latency reduction.

        Result: 12.5MB → 8MB, cross-platform support (CPU/GPU/NPU).

Final Metrics:
Metric	Original Model	Compressed Model
Size	300MB	8MB (↓97%)
CPU Latency	120ms	18ms (↑6.7x)
Accuracy (GLUE)	82.3%	80.6% (↓1.7%)

Key Tools: PyTorch (Distillation/Quantization), ONNX Runtime, TensorRT.
Use Case: Mobile NLP, IoT devices, real-time applications.

    Pro Tip: For <5MB models, add pruning and sparsity. Trade-offs: Every 10% size reduction ≈ 0.5% accuracy drop.
